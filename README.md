# Changing Environments
This project will observe the relative improvement in fitness of a digital organism moved from its natural environment to a new one, and them back.

## Researchers:
Riley Annis, Josh Nahum, Emily Dolson

## Dependencies:
Numpy, Scipy, Cython

### Necessary Files:
changing_environments_ga.py
main.py
fitness_function.pyx
cpp_fitness_function.cpp
string_org.py
real_value_vector_org.py
bit_vector_org.py

### Config File Arguenments:
* Necessary for all types:
  * org_type
  * number_of_organisms
  * mutation_rate
  * number_of_generations
  * tournament_size
  * verbose
* Necessary for string orgs:
  * target_string
  * letters
* Necessary for real value vector orgs:
  * fitness_function_type
  * crowding
  * range_minimum
  * range_maximum
  * mutation_effect_size
  * alternate_environment_corr
  * length
* Necessary for bit vector orgs:
  * length

### changing_environments_ga.py Command Line Arguements:
* -c  config file location
* -o  desired output directory

### Use With String Orgs:
Not used, possibly broken.

### Use With Real Value Vector Orgs:
I'll get to this soon, I promise.

### Use With Bit Vector Orgs (Static Environment):
* Constant:
  * LENGTH
* Class:
  * BitVectorOrg
* Methods:
  * fitness(environment)
  * is_better_than(other_org, environment)
  * get_mutant()
* Function:
  * fitness_function(genotype)


# What is the effect of enhancing memory's fitness?
 
This project aims to better understand the importance of memory's evolution, primarily by more closely tying memory into an organism's fitness.

# We assume that the user has anaconda/miniconda installed

# Build Environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Startup Environmnet
```
conda activate memGA
```

# Example Run Command
```
python changing_environment_ga.py -c quick_test.ini -o output_test
```
